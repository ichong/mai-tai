###Waikiki
    
>Warm perfumes like a breath from vine and tree  
>Drift down the darkness. Plangent, hidden from eyes  
>Somewhere an 'eukaleli' thrills and cries  
>And stabs with pain the night's brown savagery.  
>And dark scents whisper; and dim waves creep to me,  
>Gleam like a woman's hair, stretch out, and rise;  
>And new stars burn into the ancient skies,  
>Over the murmurous soft Hawaian sea.  
>
>And I recall, lose, grasp, forget again,  
>And still remember, a tale I have heard, or known,  
>An empty tale, of idleness and pain,  
>Of two that loved, or did not love, and one  
>Whose perplexed heart did evil, foolishly,  
>A long while since, and by some other sea
